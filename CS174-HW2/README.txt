This is a story about two wizards fighting in the sky.

My custom shape are the one used as wizard's body and the diamonds on the wands.

I first used look_at() to make camera rotate around a wizard.
Then follow it when he dodge the attack in 14 second.
And then let camera focusing on the fire attack in 17 second.
